# Block Hunter
Nowadays, blockchain-based technologies are being
developed in various industries to improve data security. In the
context of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), a chain-based
network is one of the most notable applications of blockchain
technology. IIoT devices have become increasingly prevalent in
our digital world, especially in support of developing smart
factories. Although blockchain is a powerful tool, it is vulnerable
to cyber attacks. Detecting anomalies in blockchain-based IIoT
networks in smart factories is crucial in protecting networks and
systems from unexpected attacks. In this paper, we use Federated
Learning (FL) to build a threat hunting framework called Block
Hunter to automatically hunt for attacks in blockchain-based
IIoT networks. Block Hunter utilizes a cluster-based architecture
for anomaly detection combined with several machine learning
models in a federated environment. To the best of our knowledge,
Block Hunter is the first federated threat hunting model in IIoT
networks that identifies anomalous behavior while preserving
privacy. Our results prove the efficiency of the Block Hunter in
detecting anomalous activities with high accuracy and minimum
required bandwidth.
